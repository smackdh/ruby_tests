# For this problem, you make a function that examines an array of numbers ranging between 1 and 10 that’s missing
# one number and have the function find the number that’s missing.
# For example, the series of numbers could be [2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10].
# This array is missing the number 3. The goal of this problem is to write code that figures out that the number 3 is missing.
# Ruby has an expression called “findmissingnumber” that you can use to examine the array you’ve written.
# You can instruct Ruby to compare that array to one that has the missing number, and Ruby’s internal logic
# can pinpoint the integer that “should” be there.
