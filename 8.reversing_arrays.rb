# In this problem, your objective is to reverse the order of the numbers in an array.
# For example, if your array was [8, 2, 9, 4], you would want your code to return [4, 9, 2, 8].
# To accomplish this in Ruby, your primary tool will be the “reverse” expression,
# which examines an array and flips the order of the values in it. You’ll also use a “while”
# expression and designate the position of each number to dictate which numbers to apply the “reverse” expression to.

# 1. This challenge was likely outdated, as you can use reverse directly on an array either way.

array = [3,2,1]
puts array.reverse
