# You can use Ruby to analyze a number to see if it has repeated digits in it.
# Your objective is to use Ruby to validate whether or not the number is made up of a series of the same digit in a row.
# For example, the number 555 would qualify. A number with only two out of three digits repeating, such as 554,
# wouldnâ€™t qualify.
# The key to solving this Ruby problem is to isolate each digit in the series and then compare them to each other.
# To do this, you separate the digits and put them in an array, which allows Ruby to look at them as individual units.
