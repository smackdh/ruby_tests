## To create an algorithm that finds prime numbers, you have to decide if the number in question can only be divided by itself and 1. To do that,
# you have to check if the number can be divided by itself and each number below it, down to 1.
# The process in Ruby is to check whether each number is divisible by these integers, and if it is,
# then Ruby designates it as a prime number.

# -- Psuedo -- #
# 1. Create a method that takes one argument
# 2. Check so that number is higher than 1, if not = not prime
# 3. Check if its even, if it is = not prime
# 4. Check all numbers from 2(first prime) to square root of the number input, and iterate over
# 5. In iteration, check that original number divided by the iteration number is NOT 0.
# 6. If its not, it's a prime!
# 7. Else, not prime
