# A Fibonacci Sequence is created by adding two numbers to create the next number in the sequence.
# You then sum that number with the one preceding it to get the next number,, and so on.
# For example, if you have the sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, then the next number in the sequence is 55.
# To do this in Ruby, you can use a “while” expression to create a starting value and then
# tell Ruby which integers to add together.
