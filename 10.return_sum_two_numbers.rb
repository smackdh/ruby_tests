# This challenge calls on you to write a function that adds together two numbers within an argument. For instance, if you have an argument like this: (5, 4), you want your function to add them to get their sum.
# For Ruby to do this, you’ll also use the “addition” expression, which tells Ruby to add the two values within the argument.
